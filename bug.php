In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys.  Consider this scenario:

```php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["1"] = "Value 1";
$myArray[1] = "Value 2";

var_dump($myArray);
```

You might expect two separate elements. However, PHP's loose typing will treat both "1" (string) and 1 (integer) as the same key, leading to only "Value 2" being stored. This behavior is often unexpected and can cause hard-to-debug issues, especially when using data from external sources.

Another example involving `isset()`:
```php
$arr = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];

if (isset($arr['a'])) {
    echo "a exists";
}

if (isset($arr[0])) {
    echo "0 exists";
}
```
The second `isset()` will return `false` because integer keys are treated differently from string keys, even if they have the same value.

Similarly, using `array_key_exists()` will also exhibit this behavior, causing unexpected outputs.
